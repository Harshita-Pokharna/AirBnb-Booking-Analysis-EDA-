Hosts should  consider investing in property in areas with relatively fewer listings in order to differentiate themselves from the competition.

* Different neighborhoods in New York offer varying accommodation options, with some neighborhoods being more popular among guests than others.Brooklyn comes in second with significant number of listings and cheaper prices as compared to the Manhattan: With most listings located in Williamsburg and Bedford Stuyvesant two neighborhoods strategically close to Manhattan tourists get the chance to enjoy both boroughs equally while spending less.
